Hey, Laura.
Don't worry about your Geology degree. One of my agents took care of it.
Are you sure you don't want to help me with the project? Your talents would be invaluable.

Please think about it.

Hey, thanks.
I can't join your little project, and you KNOW why. I'm too tied up with work at the moment.
