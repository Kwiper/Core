Dear Mr. Ribbons,
I am writing on behalf of the CSA. We believe you are using your company, Sysco, in order to create illicit programs used for accessing people's networks.
This e-mail is to notify you that a representative of the CSA will be in touch with you shortly in order to investigate your company.
Make sure there are no illegal programs lying around.
Regards,
Tim Rob, Communications at the CSA</email>

Dear Mr. Chuck Ribbons,
I am honoured to have been promoted to Head of Design after you fired the previous head. 
However, I find it odd that I have not been invited into the head of staff IRC channel yet. I feel that would be important in order for me to fulfill my duties as Head.
Thank you again,
-Mat Elliot, Head of Design.
===========================================
Dear Mat Elliot,
Of course you will be invited into the head of staff IRC channel. That was simply a mistake on my part, and I deeply apologise for not giving you access to it earlier.
