<body>We're getting closer to being able to stop F-Stop from completing ICaRUS. 
You will work with Hel to investigate an ex-employee of F-Stop who may have some valuable information we desperately need.
Find any files related to ICaRUS and upload them to the drop server. We're nearing the endgame here.

I'm counting on you guys.
