<body>Agent, in order for our plans to succeed in the grand scheme of things, there is a certain individual we will need to track the movements of.
His name is Sam Valeska. By day, he's a music artist. By night, he's part of something greater, based on my investigations.
In the drop server, I have uploaded a little virus I've been working on called rootwyrm. It will allow us to track Sam Valeska's activities.
Download the virus and upload it to the /sys folder on any of Sam's computers you find.
