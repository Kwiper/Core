We will need you to add our faction's IP to D Corp's, commonly known as Devil Corp, whitelist server. This is an imperative part of our operation. DO NOT DELETE THE WHITELIST.
We want this to be as discreet as possible. The only way to do that is to add this DHS's IP to their whitelist. 
The IP, in case you forget, is 225.102.52.23. There's no way for me to directly link you to D Corp's servers, so we'll have to make do with an employee.
She frequents Jim Thorton's a lot, so maybe you'll find her there. Her name is Laura Nakamura.
