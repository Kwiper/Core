<body>With the aftermath of that attack, it is imperative that we stop F-Stop and ICaRUS once and for all.
To do that, we will need some resources. Now, a contact of mine at the CSA has told me that Sysco is under investigation for developing illicit port crushers.
It is your job to break in to Sysco and snag a copy of any port crushers we don't have yet. Upload it to the drop server once you get it.
