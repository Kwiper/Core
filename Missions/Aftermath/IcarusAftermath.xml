<body>Hey.
I'm assuming you're confused as to what happened. 
Short answer is: ICaRUS destroyed Core and deleted all our port crushers, as well as refreshed our VMs.
Don't worry though, I backed up the sequencers for ICaRUS in a secret location. Not even ICaRUS could find it. 
I've sent the other two to get back their port crushers. I'll expect you to do the same. 
I'll try to get Core back up and running. For the time being, though, reclaim those port crushers. You'll need them.
