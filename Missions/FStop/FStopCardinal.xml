<body>F-Stop is at the center of everything our previous targets have been doing. We have to find out what they actually are doing first before we make any rash decisions.
Your mission is to investigate F-Stop Laboratories' network. Find out anything you can. Help each other if you need it. If you find anything worthwhile, upload it to the drop server.

I'm counting on you guys
